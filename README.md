### Weakening the iterator category of some standard algorithms

This repository contains a proposal to make the C++ standard library algorithms `std::sort`,
`std::stable_sort` and `std::inplace_merge` work with forward and bidirectional iterators
instead of only working with random-access iterators.

The following files are available:

* [P0227R0](P0227R0.pdf)
* [Slides](http://slides.com/morwenn/weakening-the-iterator-categories-of-some-sorting-algorithms/#/) for the WG21 meeting in Jacksonville
